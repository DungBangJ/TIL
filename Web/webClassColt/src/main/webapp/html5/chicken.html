    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
    Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
    male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
    called a pullet.
</p>
<p>
    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
    period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
    meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
        An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
        'hen'.[10][11]

        Other terms are:
    <ul>
        <li>
            'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken<sup>[12]</sup><sub>[13]</sub>
        </li>
        <li>'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]</li>
        <li>'Chick:' a young chicken[14]</li>
        <li>'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia, informal)[15]</li>
        <li>'Cockerel:' a young male chicken less than a year old[16]</li>
        <li>'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
            immature
            chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
        </li>
        <li>'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]</li>
    </ul>

    "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage
    on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American
    English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic
    fowl'.[20]

    'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]
    </p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>
    According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
    as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[22][23][24] and is widely used
    throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]
</p>

<h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
<p>
    Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
    animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

    The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16
    years according to Guinness World Records.[30]
    Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed
    feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those
    of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
    pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or
    eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and
    female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or
    cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other
    fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and
    combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several
    chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]

    Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying
    for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally
    fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<h4>Social behaviour</h4>
<p>
    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs
    and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with
    dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
    causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
    younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[32]

    When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well
    as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and
    encourage them to eat.

    A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[33]
    However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly
    after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a
    predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[34]
</p>

<h4>Crowing</h4>
<p>
    Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well,
    crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[35]
