    The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
    Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
    male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
    called a pullet.

    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
    period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
    meat and eggs) and as pets.
